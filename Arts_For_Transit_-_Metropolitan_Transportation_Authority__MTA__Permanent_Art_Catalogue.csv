LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Atlantic Terminal,Babylon Branch,Allan and Ellen,Wexler,Overlook,2009,Granite,"The new MTA Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn features an artist/architect collaboration in a soaring, light-filled atrium. The project architects, di Domenico + Partners collaborated with the artists, Allan Wexler and Ellen Wexler, to create a special place of arrival in the entry pavilion which reaches from the street level down to the ticket office, waiting room and LIRR and NYC Transit subways. *The Wexlers created a two-story sculptural balcony and wall that visually evokes the adventure of travel. Titled {Overlook}, its rocky granite form cantilevers above the main concourse at the Terminal, referencing scenic overlooks often found in national parks, where travelers are encouraged to pause and take in the larger scene. The bands of granite also refer to nature found underground in layers of rock. Allan Wexler commented, We sought to create the experience of viewing an urban public space as if it were a nature setting, using granite tiles mathematically pixilated to create nooks and crannies found in rock walls. Ellen Wexler said, We wanted to create a space where one can stop and take in the dynamic energy, which is as exciting as stopping to take in the Grand Canyon or other major vista. *{Overlook} is framed by a pair of sweeping staircases and a glass and stainless steel balcony/railing that flows with the architecture of the space, which promises to be a Brooklyn landmark, akin to Grand Central Terminal's famous clock. *Allan Wexler and Ellen Wexler have created public art works nationwide, often using familiar forms imbued with new meanings and functions, fostering a new way of looking at or using the specific site. The materials used often are construction materials, as in the case of {Overlook}.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=babylonbranch&artist=1&station=1
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Valley Stream,Babylon Branch,Malin,Abrahamsson,On the Trail of the Rising Sun,2008,"Glass and ceramic mosaic on West Stair Wall, Escalator Wall and Platform Waiting Room","At Valley Stream Station a series of mosaic works fills the new platform waiting room with works of calming color and charming vistas.  *Portraying the skies and scenery of the area, Swedish-born and Brooklyn-based artist Malin Abrahamsson creates a broad swath of green bands punctuated with more detailed mosaics of local sights, such as a pair of Canadian Geese, a house, and the nearby clock tower. *Two other large mosaic panels hang above the west stairway and escalator, showing a pale blue sky with a touch of green at the bottom, a seagull in flight, and floating clouds. The works bring to commuters a painter's sensibility with views of the rolling lawns and shrubs of the close-by suburbs, under expansive skies.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=babylonbranch&artist=1&station=2
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Merrick,Babylon Branch,Alan,Sonfist,The Narrative History of Merrick,1993,Hand-painted porcelain tile on platform columns,"Mounted on the elevated train platform's concrete pillars, the series consists of eight panels of hand, painted tile that depict the community's past and its links to the nearby sea.  As the artist described the concept,   I will create a series of tiles tracing the history of Long Island, beginning in the Ice Age, through paintings of rocks and plant life. The next stage would show how the Native Americans interacted with plants and sea life, followed by the first Europeans, who settled in Long Island and established farms and a seafaring industry.  Later, a tourist industry developed, as well as several advanced industries. ... The early history of Merrick describes developed grain farms with cows and sheep.... The railroad eventually became a bridging device to bring together the surrounding communities and contributed greatly to the development of contemporary Long Island.  The artwork was created in conjunction with the installation at the Bellmore Station, the station east of Merrick.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=babylonbranch&artist=1&station=3

LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Seaford,Babylon Branch,Carson,Fox,Blue Sky Pursuit,2009,Laminated and tempered glass,"At the Seaford Station 14 laminated glass windows extend the sky, creating a bright blue fantasy filled with butterflies and birds, their flights traced with dots of clear glass that meander, overlap and reveal paths of movement, speaking to migration and the act of travel.  The dots also transform the sunlight and enliven the landscape.  Artist Carson Fox used bird and butterfly images inspired from Victorian era engravings, an aesthetic where natural life is a lush and swarming profusion.  *They were created from a process that includes painting on the glass. The 14 windows, eight on the north side of the waiting room and six on the south,  combine to create a special place for commuters as they mark the start of their day in a space made radiant by the artist's vision.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=babylonbranch&artist=1&station=5
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Hempstead,Hempstead Branch,Ron,Baron,Lost and Found: An Excavation Project,2005,Cast bronze sculpture and seating in plaza,"From afar the tower of luggage is puzzling; draw closer and you see that the luggage is cast in bronze and colored in a natural patina.  The multi-faceted installation includes special cast bronze seating and memorabilia that speaks to the community's heritage and memories.  Among the Long Island-related items are an edition of {Newsday} featuring the Islanders winning the Stanley Cup, an NBA basketball (Julius Erving was from nearby Roosevelt), a Jets football reflecting the team practices at Hofstra University, and yearbooks from Hempstead High School highlighting community events, such as Martin Luther King's address to students of the high school in 1968.  Ron Baron refers to himself as a cultural archaeologist; and he culls everyday objects from streets and sidewalks, thrift shops, and garage sales.  He then forms his monuments, geological constructs of his finds, which transform the objects into something completely new.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=hempsteadbranch&artist=1&station=2
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Bay Shore,Montauk Branch,Brit,Bunkley,Bay Shore Icons,1992,Cast cement relief medallions and frieze on exterior of station,"Brit Bunkley created a suite of modern architectural elements that overlay the station's columns.  The cast stone elements include round medallions, symbolic of clocks, at each end of the station that are set above framed icons representing local history and transportation.  To highlight the advantages of public transportation, the artist created a frieze portraying cars in a traffic jam.  Since I thought the architecture of the waiting areas looked like a 'Prairie Style Doric Temple,' I designed the extended lintel as a Prairie Style window-like structure (which also mimics the LIRR train windows), says the artist.  The images within... include pleasure boats, a beach umbrella/arrow with egg (a reference to the egg and dart molding), and a Fire Island lighthouse as a chess piece.  Taken together, the work adds visual interest and a holiday spirit to both a commuter station and a major launching point for visits to the seashore.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=montaukbranch&artist=1&station=2
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Penn Station,Penn Station,Andrew,Leicester,Ghosts Series,1994,Terra cotta wall murals in five locations and porcelain enamel above escalator,"Andrew Leicester's {Ghost Series} consists of five monumental bas-relief terra cotta murals installed throughout the Long Island Rail Road station. The pieces evoke the building's illustrious predecessor, the 1910 Pennsylvania Station building by McKim, Mead and White that was demolished in 1963, an event that triggering the historic preservation movement.  Fragments of the old Penn Station are hidden in the lower depths of the building that replaced it, and the murals symbolically reveal the old building now hidden behind new walls. *In {Day and Night}, a 500-square-foot-mural in the main concourse, Leicester reinterprets Adolph Wineman's sculpture of the same name that presided over the old station's entrances, depicting two women flanking a gigantic clock.  The artist embedded the date the original building was demolished - 10/28/63 - into the clock's blank face.  Other murals include Mercury Man, a reproduction of another sculptural figure, and a porcelain-on-steel rendering of blueprints for the demolished building.  Taken together, {Ghost Series} is a compelling memento mori - a reminder that we are mortal.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=pennstation&artist=1&station=1
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Penn Station,Penn Station,Maya,Lin,Eclipsed Time,1994,"Sand-blasted glass, aluminum, stainless steel, and fiber-optic sculpture in ceiling at Seventh Avenue end of station","In {Eclipsed Time} Maya Lin tries to get commuters to think differently about time and trains.  I'm asking for a one-on-one relationship between the viewer and the work, the artist says.  The large metal sculpture, installed overhead in the Long Island Rail Road's main concourse at Penn Station, combines industrial craftsmanship with contemporary technology to tell time.  When people think about clocks they usually envision hands or digital numbers, explains Lin. Time is measured mathematically and specifically.  I wanted to reflect time naturally and chose to use the concept of an eclipse.  To create this effect, a solid disk hangs between the light source and a stationary glass disk.  Light shines through the glass disk, illuminating the rotunda below.  The solid disk travels from east to west and back.  An eclipse is created at midnight, as the two disks are aligned and only a penumbra of light shines around the aligned circles.  The cycle is repeated daily.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=pennstation&artist=2&station=1
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Hicksville,Port Jefferson Branch,Roy,Nicholson,"Morning Transit, Hempstead Plain & Evening Transit, Hempstead Plain",2002,Glass mosaics on waiting room walls,"In the {Morning Transit, Hempstead Plain & Evening Transit, Hempstead Plain} murals, Roy Nicholson takes viewers back in time.  The area around Hicksville was once a notable rarity, an example of an original prairie landscape most often associated with the Midwest.  Nicholson recaptures that setting, in look and spirit, as if seen from a speeding train.  The colors vary according to the time of day depicted - soft green and blue hues for sunrise in {Morning Transit}, and red and blue hues for sunset in {Evening Transit}.  Each commuter imagines his or her own personal scenery, says Nicholson.  One can look at it over and over again and discover new images.  The artist creates a contemplative meditation on landscape and rewards the viewer with an affectionate look back at Long Island before the post-war housing boom forever altered the landscape.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=portjeffersonbranch&artist=1&station=2
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Huntington,Port Jefferson Branch,Joe,Zucker,"For My Grandfather Noye Pride, a Locomotive Engineer",1998,Faceted glass in windscreen,"At Huntington, Joe Zucker's 130-foot fantasy train chugs animatedly down the platform while serving as a windscreen.  Each faceted glass panel shows a cartoon-like flatcar hauling Long Island wares and sights, one to a car.  We see an oversized lobster, giant duck, jumbo potatoes, and a big bluefish.  Other images are the  Montauk lighthouse and a sailboat.  Zucker's fanciful images - the bluefish is green, the potato is blue - are rendered in faceted glass, equally powerful day and night.  Says Zucker; I hope that this piece brings travelers enjoyment, that it gives them memories and of Long Island and moments of pleasure.  As the title indicates, members of the artist's family were employed on the railroad:  It is in memory of my grandfather and uncles who served as engineers and firemen on the trains of a distant past.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=portjeffersonbranch&artist=1&station=3
MNR,Metro-North Railroad,Grand Central Terminal,Grand Central Terminal,Ellen,Driscoll,"As Above, So Below",1998,"Glass, bronze, and mosaic in Grand Central North passageway","The historic ceiling in the main concourse at Grand Central Terminal reveals the night sky with golden stars that form the constellations.  Grand Central becomes a metaphor for our connection with the wider world beyond New York City and {As Above, So Below} takes the viewer around the world to the night sky above five different continents, representing myths, civilization, heavens, and the underworld.  These scenes bring to life ancient tales that demonstrate how the stories told about the heavens reflect the way we live on earth.  A close look  at any of the faces in the work reveal their diversity,  as indeed, the people in these mosaics represent many different backgrounds.  However, the artist has altered them to take on the attributes of mythical figures.  The work summons the everlasting and the ephemeral, reminding us of our spiritual and worldly past while we hurry through the station.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=mnr&line=grandcentralterminal&artist=1&station=1
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Broadway Station,Port Washington Branch,Jean,Shin,Celadon Remnants,2008,Ceramic and glass mosaic on south stair walls and station building,"Motorists, pedestrians, and commuters are the beneficiaries of the eloquent beauty of {Celadon Remnants} at the LIRR's Broadway Station in Flushing, Queens. *Using celadon fragments, artist Jean Shin created large-scale mosaic murals that feature the shapes and silhouettes of pottery.  The mosaics are installed on the south stair walls (facing Northern Boulevard) and in architectural niches in the station building.  The vessel or teapot forms were created from thousands of celadon fragments, hand-selected and donated by the city of Icheon, South Korea. The grayish-green forms against a white tile background create an abstract interplay between the positive and negative colored shapes. The aesthetic appeal of celadon lies in its eloquent beauty and simplicity.  Derived from ancient China and perfected in Korea, celadon wares are among the most widely admired of Korean ceramics. *If a vessel is imperfect, it becomes scrap and there are mountains of fragments in the Icheon region of Korean.  Shin was determined to use these cast-off fragments, and the artwork serves as a metaphor for the history, culture, and identity of the Asian population in Queens. For Shin, the thriving Asian-American communities neighboring the Broadway Station bear resemblance to the {Celadon Remnants} - as each are transformed in a new location in a distinctively new form while preserving their cultural heritage.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=portwashingtonbranch&artist=1&station=1
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Bayside Station,Port Washington Branch,Ed,McGowin,Bayside Story,1999,Bronze relief columns and frieze on overpass,"{Bayside Story} features spiral friezes that wrap around the support columns, bearing animal and floral motifs as well as bronze reliefs that celebrate local history and culture.   Indians paddling a canoe have a central position in the work.  Around them are a settler's homestead, a Revolutionary war soldier, a farm, and Fort Totten.  Boxer Gentleman Jim Corbett represents local heroes; a yacht and checkered flag portray local amusements.  Once home to the Native American Matinecocks, in the late 1800s, the wealthy built estates in Bayside.  In the early 1900's, the community was the home to stars of the silver screen. *Commenting on the artwork, Ed McGowin, stated, Community history can so easily be lost or forgotten...I consulted with the Bayside Historical Society and the community to choose significant local events and people....  The compelling result proudly tells the story of Bayside.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=portwashingtonbranch&artist=1&station=2
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Great Neck,Port Washington Branch,David,Saunders,Conductor's Watch and Key Chain,1992,Aluminum sculpture on platform wall,"To symbolize the romance and excitement of train travel's rich history, all under watchful eye of the train conductor, David Saunders immortalized the conductor's watch and key chain.  Made of aluminum tubing to echo the handrails and silver pipes that run along the walls of the station platform, the sculpture blends into the overall design of the site. The chain mimics the movement of the Long Island Rail Road's long silver trains that take commuters to and from their destinations, says Saunders, those speedy back and forth movements are echoed in the long swooping gestures of the sculpture's silver lines.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=portwashingtonbranch&artist=1&station=3
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Ronkonkoma,Ronkonkoma Branch,Alice,Adams,Planting (dedicated to Long Island Tree Farmers),1995,"Paving, planting, seating, curving brick walls, and cast concrete tree balls with cast aluminum rope inserts","{Planting} is composed of a planters and trees, with paving, plantings, and curved brick walls that define the space.  The artist intent was to create an ensemble of functional and sculptural forms that is unique and specific to the region and together with the architectural structures makes a place that is memorable.  Working with landscape architects, Adams had trees planted in rows within islands created by brick walls and placed tree ball concrete planters in the paved areas.  The trees salute the importance of the nursery business and tree farming to Long Island's growth.  To suggest tree balls and allow the planting of the trees, Adams designed a pre-cast concrete ring with metal support elements in the form of ropes that extend upward.  Adams worked to reflect the station's design; the curved dormers of the station building are echoed in the curved walls.  Her work articulates the placement of the buildings and platforms in relation to one another, creating a pleasant and harmonious space for those traveling through.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=ronkonkomabranch&artist=1&station=3
LIRR,Long Island Rail Road,Greenport,Ronkonkoma Branch,Anita,Thacher,Illuminated Station,2005,Lighting and projection on station façade and roof,"{Illuminated Station} takes us to the past when Greenport, and the North Fork of Long Island, was home to farmers, fishermen, storekeepers, and railroad workers.  Today Greenport is the hub of a growing population of year-round and seasonal residents, an artists' haven and departure point for vacation spots nearby.  Anita Thacher creates evocative light-works - art whose effect is created through electrical illumination.  Here she uses numerous lighting techniques.  The stationhouse's roof is outlined with LED illumination in blue, and the areas surrounding the building are given a deeper blue light.  From inside the building comes a yellow glow suggesting candle light or gaslight.  On the station walls and roof, projected light forms images of an American Indian pictograph, emphasizing the importance of the first people to live on Long Island.  The man and canoe in the pictograph was made from a plaster cast of an Indian artifact discovered in nearby Orient.  Through each work the past meets the present and a special place in the community is made more meaningful by the artist.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=lirr&line=ronkonkomabranch&artist=1&station=4

The work is one of the more fragile pieces in the system, executed in a multi-media collage that he describes as: ...consisting of layers of gesso, under-painting, urethane, and varnish, I also utilize natural materials - rice paper and a dusting of peat moss - to give my work added texture, strength, and beauty. *{A Field of Wild Flowers} was created to be compatible with the architecture of Grand Central Terminal, and it repeats some of its historic interior details such as the representation of fruit, acorns, and garlands.

To the ancient Greeks the olive tree symbolized freedom and purity, he explains.  And the name Sirshasana refers to a yoga headstand posture - the inverted tree ....  With branches that span twenty-five feet and 5,000 brilliant crystal pendants, the tree dominates the area, bringing the feel of an outdoor market.  The space was designed so that morning sun bathes the tree and floods the market with light.  The form has writhing, enticing, and unexpected elements, with the base of the tree finished in gold and crystals dangling in place of olives   In addition to alluding to the decorative chandeliers in Grand Central, the tree is a comment on the allure of the exotic and tempting wares sold in the marketplace.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=mnr&line=grandcentralterminal&artist=3&station=1

Trains have often been associated by African Americans with escape and the Underground Railroad in particular.  In the words of the artist, ...these pieces...create a simple narrative of two people.  One, the young woman coming to the city in hopes of advancing her career, the other, a successful businessman leaving the city to return to his hometown.  I believe these two scenarios to be examples of how many Americans have used the railroads to and from New York throughout history.  Yet I was also addressing the specific and rich tradition of the role of the railroad in general in the lives of African Americans.

The local agricultural economy may be shrinking, but it remains an important part of our community and rural landscape.  The Wassaic area had turned to dairy farming in the mid-nineteenth century - due to the conjunction of a historical event and an invention.  The event was the Civil War; the invention, the development of canned milk, in great demand by the Union army for its soldiers.

The station is a busy site and an entry point to a community that is alive 24/7. *For the bridge, sculptor Terry Adkins's created {Harlem Encore} in two distinct silhouetted aluminum relief panels.  The work celebrates Harlem's past achievements and bright future.  In the polished images that flank the bridge's western façade, Adkins has memorialized the Afro-Atlantic ancestors with figures that reflect the spiritual triumph over adversity.  On the eastern side the art salutes continuity and urban life with figures seen in the midst of skyscrapers.  On both sides, sphinxes and streaming suns add strength, dignity, and timelessness.  At night, blue back lighting accentuates {Harlem Encore}'s powerful presence on the street.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=mnr&line=harlemline&artist=2&station=1

The photographs were translated into glass mosaic to capture the atmospheric progression and the iridescent quality of the evening sky.*The 1,228-square-foot mosaic brings a romantic moment into an urban setting while welcoming riders to the community. Speaking about her inspiration for the new artwork, Harvey said, Everyone knows Yankee Stadium as 'the Home of the Stars' but in the busy streets of the Bronx, where the city lights drown out the sky, it's easy to forget the real stars.

The cast aluminum sculptures are located on the sides of the bridge the trains use and can be viewed both by commuters at the station and by those passing by on the streets below.  The artist, a Yonkers resident, consulted both art-historical and scientific sources to evoke the river's past.  Segal was taken by the fact that the river in this area can actually flow upstream as well as down, depending on tidal conditions.  She explained to the {Westchester Times}: The work is an abstract representation of the river...The sun and moon will constantly change the lighting on the sculpture, and the shadows will change with the sunrise and sunset.

In a train station, time often means minutes to hurry or to wait through.  But this mural allows the traveler an opportunity for a different view. Like a time line, this mosaic reveals nature as a vehicle of change.

This is no longer the case. Felipe Galindo's {Magic Realism in Kingsbridge} stems from his study of the area's residents and his hopes that the imagery in his designs will engage the audience, inspiring them to meditate on their surroundings and see things they take for granted in a different way. *Galindo says he sought to discover the unexpected treasures in the neighborhood-its life, diversity, nature, and most of all the power of imagination. Each element in the faceted glass panels presents a surprising scene. For example, a tropical island is found in the Harlem River, and a fire escape leads to the heavens, providing a sense of magic.

As a child on shopping trips, notes Grajales, I found the station dull and colorless.  I wanted to give people something cheerful but also calming - a refuge in the city.

A realistic beluga whale slides behind a commuter to read the newspaper headlines, and in another scene, a manatee waits patiently for a train seen approaching in the tunnel.  Turtles dive off a subway platform in the title piece of the series.  I wanted to explore the analogy between subway travel and the movement of our fellow creatures through their natural environment, Brown says.

A fused glass wall reveals images of tree limbs and leaves in silhouette adapted from photographic imagery. These formations relate to the place above, Battery Park, the historic fortress and Manhattan's southern boundary. The glass brings light and poetry to the station, the City's first new subway station in decades. *Companion pieces show a decayed over-scaled leaf that refers to the passage of time and links the park to its historical role. A map, that shows contemporary Manhattan and old New York as an overlay, is a beautiful mosaic and eloquent expression of the city's evolution, conveying to the throngs who use the station, a sense of its significant location. The artists designed a laser-cut stainless steel fence to separate the entry from the paid section of the station; its leaf motif connects the art in the station with the surrounding environment. *The Starns' work combines various forms, such as sculpture, painting, video, and installation. Their work has been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide for more than two decades. In South Ferry, their explorations of light and dark, nature and technology, come together in an evocative artwork. Its title refers, among other associations, to the South Ferry subway line, which becomes a network of splitting lines that travels through the changing landscape as seen in the map.

With this movement in mind I have made works using several sculptural elements linking areas of a site into a single concept.  I looked at the station's existing tile frieze and continued the frieze as a relief tile band.

Eric Fischl's work is narrative and this work follows in this tradition.  A series of murals takes commuters from the familiar to the bizarre circus world.  I thought it would be amusing, Fischl says, to do a contemporary Dante's Inferno, to turn commuting into a spiritual quest.  The murals portray fire-breathers, acrobats, and animals; gradually one realizes that a commuter has left home and been pulled into the circus, where he meets incredible circus characters and then, on the other side of the tent, he emerges in the white light and harmony, a commuter again, but transported and transformed.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=A&artist=1&station=6

In the 1960s, Held moved from abstraction to tightly controlled geometric work, with two-dimensional figures suspended on the canvas.  Held was curious about how everything is structured and was inspired by theories about the universe and its mysteries.  He described his interest in images that we believe in but that are beyond our senses and that we can never experience directly.   There is also another subject, that of buildings and architecture.  His imagery powerfully evokes New York City's contemporary energy while acknowledging the forms and styles of the Midtown skyscrapers overhead.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=E&artist=1&station=5

The {Gothic Circle} symbolizes endurance, renewal and perpetuity, and is designed to inspire commuters traveling to and from work.

It pulls the city together, pulls people together in a magic way.  Here I show the subway riders at night after a hard day's work.  Everyone is separate, alone, but very much together.  It's noisy with the creaks and squeals, but peaceful too, because we move to a rhythm and cadence that gets inside us; that's comforting, like the noise of the city itself.

The artist extensively researched the neighborhood's history, and created by watercolor sketches that were transformed into glass mosaic murals by craftsmen.  The images of Shad Crossing celebrate the return of the once abundant fish to New York and water as a metaphor for crossing. {Delancey Orchard} is the mural on the Manhattan-bound platform, inspired by the prominent  DeLancey family's eighteenth century farm, which stretched from the East River to the Hudson River.

NYCT,New York City Transit,Neptune Avenue,F,Michael,Krondl,Looking Up,2004,Faceted glass in platform windscreens,"Michael Krondl describes {Looking Up} as a series of photographically-derived images that creates a movie for the subway rider as he or she leaves the leafy residential neighborhoods and reaches Coney Island, seen of in the distance.  Krondl selected his images for their properties and how they reflect and refract light.  His sources include the nearby foliage and the sky, which is a big part of the experience of riding the elevated train in Brooklyn, and Coney Island's famous Cyclone roller coaster.  The transition from image to image mimics a camera panning from the nearby trees to the sky above and finally to the Cyclone in the distance.  For the F train passenger the experience is almost cinematic.  The foliage, the clouds, and the roller coaster all play with transparency; light-colored sky outlines the trestlework on the Cyclone, peeks out between the leaves, and envelops the bright white clouds.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=F&artist=1&station=8

At times the murals recall blossoming flowers, twisting branches, or meandering patterns that mimic genetic elements. The challenge in translating the artist's work-on-paper into the faceted glass murals was to capture the detail and complexity of the compositions while maintaining their captivating qualities.

The station is on the approximate site of a former roller coaster ride.  The architect, Jim McConnell of Daniel Frankfurt, wanted to transform the exterior station walls in a unique way.  Working with the architects, artist Vito Acconci developed an architectural treatment for the station façade that is full of life.  As in successful collaborations, there is no clear delineation between the architecture and the art. *Before rehabilitation, the windscreens blocked ocean views; the new windscreens open up the platform view of the Atlantic Ocean.   In the artist's words, The normally horizontal and vertical steel windscreen tubes and panels have been transformed into a more sinuous form that evokes the notion of a wave, or that of motion as in the Cyclone or the subway itself.

The artist seeks to spark the viewers' imaginations, perhaps hoping that interpretations will emerge over repeated viewings and rumination.  The tone of the messages are enigmatic:  are they optimistic or pessimistic; are they speaking of the past or to the future?   I kept my titles brief, Chang says.  I wanted them to be challenging.

The sculpture respects the physical constraints of the station architecture and succeeds in reshaping them through the use of light and materials to construct a powerful memorial to the Lost Battalion - a group of World War I soldiers, mostly New Yorkers, who were lost in battle.  Pablo Tauler uses materials that eerily suggests the Argonne Forest where the soldiers met their fate.  Muscular steel slabs evoke armaments glass refracts light, and organically shaped iron forms twist like branches.  For the sculptor the ironwork inspires memories of the wilderness marshes near his childhood home.  I am profoundly aware of the importance of the environment to my art, he says.

Some depict Carnegie Hall's classical pedigree, such as Leonard Bernstein and Marian Anderson, for example, while others portray the Beatles, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Eleanor Roosevelt, as testament to the importance of the stage.  Nearby, hundreds of white tiles with text commemorate the names, professions, and appearance date of notables who graced Carnegie's stage.  In the words of Carnegie Hall activist Gino Francesconi:  I have always felt that the subway station directly below Carnegie Hall should reflect the history of the building just as the subways of Moscow and Paris do their own cultural institutions ... It reminds one of the connection between the city and its art.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=N&artist=1&station=4

Each of these areas inspired artist Mark Hadjipateras, whose glass mosaics are rendered in a playful cartoon-like style. {City Dwellers} animates the walls of the station with a series of robot-like creatures. The figures are joyous and fanciful, but closer examination reveals universal symbols and forms that reflect  the neighborhood and its history - technology, toys, and commerce.  These inventions invite riders to guess at their meanings; while they may seem familiar, the artist holds the key. In his proposal, Hadjipateras cited some of his plentiful sources: plants and flowers, patterns based on national flags, Greek ethnic garb, a family, New York taxis, radio broadcast waves, etc.   Filtered through the artist's sensibility, the result is a unique and compelling station environment.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=N&artist=1&station=8

In his mosaic {Memories of 23rd Street}, Keith Godard represents area through the various hats they might have worn.  The celebrities he had in mind include Jim Brady, Oscar Wilde, Sara Bernhardt, Mark Twain, and Lillian Russell.  Godard says, In addition to bringing back memories of the specific time period and people and appealing to the viewers on a more common level as fascinating hats, this design can also serve as an interactive, playful, and witty landmark.  As a diversion, passengers waiting for the subway train might try to picture people on the opposite platform wearing the hats they are standing beneath!",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=N&artist=1&station=9

This mosaic artwork brings architectural views down below. *Ferrara has long been interested in the simple and repetitive forms of building, and she uses forms that are simple and schematic, almost primitive-looking structures.  Taken together, they lend a unity and meditative character to the space; as people move through the platforms and passageways, the images seem to shift, and no two vistas are the same.  Ferrara thinks of these as pieces of a mathematical puzzle.  The spare simplicity and economy of design attracts viewers.  Nothing is casual or unintentional in the artist's design, which she describes: This sequence of stripe/image is calculated.  It can be seen as images on a strip of film, or a line of faces framed in the windows of a passing train.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=P&artist=1&station=1

With a nod to both the past and the future- its central image is a futuristic bullet shaped car zipping through an underground station.  And not just any station, this is Times Square, in the heart of New York City. *Lichtenstein was born in New York in 1923 and spent his last years here.  {Times Square Mural} reflects his career, with references to, and variations on, his earlier works.  Lichtenstein also freely appropriated and incorporated images from the works of other artists and designers in his work.  For instance, the hooded figure at the right of the mural is from the old Buck Rogers comic strips and the iconic 42 image is from a series of drawings of the architectural detail of the subway.

Conceived and originally installed by artist Max Neuhaus, it provides a rich harmonic sound texture that emerges from a large underground vault covered by a grating. *Commenting on artwork, Neuhaus has said, For those who find and accept the work's anomaly, the island becomes a different place, separate, but including its surroundings. People, having no way of knowing that it has been deliberately made, usually claim the work as a place of their own discovering. *Installed by the artist in 1977, the artwork remained active until 1992, when Neuhaus moved abroad.

Installed within a long passageway between the subway and Grand Central Terminal above, they interpret the speed, energy and train travel imagery into a series of relief sculptures.

Instead of fasting, she ate a pomegranate and as punishment, is banished underground for six months of the year.  However, she is permitted to spend six months above ground on earth with her mother.  In mythology, the periods above and below ground were the beginning of seasons, which Beal uses in his titles.

Long known as the crossroads of the world, Times Square is famous for many things, but mostly for its crowds, particularly the spirited celebration each New Year's Eve when hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and visitors-joined by television viewers around the world, gather to watch the ball drop to usher in the New Year. Sharing hopes for the future, the huge crowds are televised against a neon background.  *In {The Revelers}, Jane Dickson celebrates this age-old impulse to gather. Her mosaic artwork consists of approximately 70 expressive life-size figures. Each is in motion, walking, gesturing, linking arms, or dancing; all enjoying themselves and each other's company. The central frieze of figures are presaged by a scattering of figures in groups of two or three walking in both directions along the corridors that lead to the central open space of the station complex, near the stairs to the 1, 2, 3 lines.

These 1919 stations, with station booths and turnstiles located in above-ground headhouses, feature wall tiles and decorative borders influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement.  Tunick's art celebrates the vintage ceramic ornamentation of the station and is inspired by her fascination with terra cotta and her childhood memories of nearby Prospect Park and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.  Tunick says her works for the sites, collectively titled {Brighton Clay Re-Leaf, Nos.1-4}, balance her respect for the stations' ceramic history, her recollection of the colors and shapes of the foliage in the park and garden, and her desire to add eye-catching modern design, which is achieved in her use of bold color, pattern, and texture in the tiles.",http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=Q&artist=1&station=10

In the waiting rooms large tri-panel bay windows that are etched with floral imagery overlook the tracks, mediating between the indoor and outdoor space.  The artist describes the work as an environment that surrounds you rather than something you stop to look at.

Shabaka designed the railings to highlight the role of the station as an important neighborhood place.  The thin and elegant diagonals of the rail create a see-through effect that helps open up the subway to the community.  A large-scale image of an African mask is boldly designed in open metalwork.  Its nose is a starkly geometric triangle, that symbolizes power and movement in some traditional cultures.  Other shapes in the mask are the changeable curving lines, that allow the form to appear to be variously awake or asleep, vigilant or distracted,  commuters, Shakaba says.

The tall and wavy metal constructions echo both the trees and stately apartment buildings lining Eastern Parkway and harmonize with the modern lines of the station house.  Most importantly, they lead the way into the station and provide aesthetic uplift for transit users.  The communities that border Eastern Parkway and the Botanic Garden are blessed with a rich natural bounty, Burns says.  We are surrounded by trees, shrubs, plants, and vines.
